## 🚀 What I Build

I'm obsessed with **large-scale distributed systems**, **ML infrastructure**, and making compute resources work smarter. I spend my time architecting systems that process hundreds of commits daily, managing bare-metal clusters, and building AI-driven optimizers.

### Core Passion Areas

**Distributed Build Orchestration**  
I love building multi-threaded, event-driven systems that coordinate complex workflows across hundreds of machines. Dynamic resource allocation, load balancing across heterogeneous hardware, and achieving sub-second latency in orchestration layers gets me excited. My sweet spot is designing schedulers that intelligently distribute workload while maintaining 99.8%+ uptime.

**ML-Powered Infrastructure Optimization**  
Applying machine learning to real infrastructure problems is where I thrive. I've built [TimeBox](https://blogs.cisco.com/innovation/optimizing-cloud-resources-reducing-your-carbon-footprint-with-timebox) — a time-series forecasting system using genetic algorithm for workload prediction. I'm passionate about using Random Forests, ensemble methods, and distributed training to solve capacity planning and predictive quality problems at scale.

**CI/CD Pipeline Architecture**  
I currently work as a senior software engineer in Cisco and build tools that integrate 50+ downstream systems, orchestrate parallel validation paths, and provide sub-linear scaling characteristics. The challenge of making complex pipelines feel instantaneous to developers is what drives me.

**Cryptographic Fingerprinting & Security**  
I've designed systems that encode intellectual capital through one-way fingerprinting for ML model ingestion. Working with crypto libraries to build tamper-proof telemetry pipelines that feed into defect prediction models is incredibly satisfying. [Patent awarded](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210326412A1/en) for this work.

**ETL & Data Pipeline Engineering**  
Building asynchronous data pipelines that consolidate multi-source streams into unified models. I've successfully built from scratch multiple tools, end-to-end requiring parsing, cleaning, and transforming heterogeneous data at scale — and in one project, turning 6-day manual processes into 10-second automated ones.

## 🧠 Interesting Problems I've Solved

**Resource Scheduler for 900+ Bare-Metal Servers**  
Designed dynamic allocation algorithms that distribute build workloads across a heterogeneous cluster. The challenge: minimize idle time while respecting hardware constraints and priority queues. Solution involved building custom heuristics that outperformed naive round-robin.

**AI-Driven Workload Predictor**  
Built ML models that analyze historical usage patterns to predict future compute demand. Used time-series forecasting with genetic algorithm and gradient boosting to optimize scheduling decisions. The system actively prevents resource contention and reduces cloud waste through intelligent pre-allocation.

**Cryptographic Device Fingerprinting Pipeline**  
Engineered a system that creates tamper-proof device signatures using one-way hashing, feeding telemetry into Random Forest models for defect prediction. The fingerprinting approach ensures data integrity while enabling ML inference on sensitive hardware telemetry from millions of devices.

**Automated Test Framework with Remote Execution**  
Created a test orchestration system that decouples UI from logic layers in large-scale Java applications. Used CORBA middleware and Façade pattern to enable headless test execution without rebuilding.

## 💡 What Drives Me

I'm energized by:
- **Systems that scale elegantly** — watching a well-designed distributed system handle 10x load without breaking a sweat
- **ML applied to real problems** — not research for research's sake, but ML that saves money, prevents failures, and optimizes resources
- **Infrastructure as code** — treating systems like software, with proper versioning, testing, and deployment pipelines
- **Performance optimization** — finding the bottlenecks, profiling the hot paths, and making things 10x faster
- **Cross-functional collaboration** — integrating 50+ tools and making them feel like one cohesive platform

I thrive in environments where I can architect systems from scratch, own the full stack, and see direct impact from my work. I'm most comfortable when dealing with complex concurrency, distributed state, and resource optimization problems.
